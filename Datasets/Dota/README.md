# DOTA: A Large-scale Dataset for Object DeTection in Aerial Images
[DOTA](https://captain-whu.github.io/DOTA/index.html) is a large-scale dataset for object detection in aerial images. It can be used to develop and evaluate object detectors in aerial images. We will continue to update DOTA, to grow in size and scope and to reflect evolving real-world conditions. For the DOTA-v1.0, as described in the paper, it contains 2806 aerial images from different sensors and platforms. Each image is of the size in the range from about 800 × 800 to 4000 × 4000 pixels and contains objects exhibiting a wide variety of scales, orientations, and shapes. These DOTA images are then annotated by experts in aerial image interpretation using 15 common object categories. The fully annotated DOTA images contains 188, 282 instances, each of which is labeled by an arbitrary (8 d.o.f.) quadrilateral.
